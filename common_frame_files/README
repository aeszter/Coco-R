These are the frame files for the version of Coco/R
that produces Ada code assuming that the FileIO
I/O library will be available.


These frame files can act as the basis for special
purpose frame files. However, the overall structure
and especially the sections marked --> must be
preserved, unless Coco/R is itself modified.
