Coco/R is a compiler generator developed by Hanspeter Moessenboeck.
See http://ssw.jku.at/Coco/ for the project home.

The Ada version (i.e. a version that is written in Ada and that generates
Ada code) has been created by Oleksandr Havva. The link given in the
documentation, http://cs.ru.ac.za/homes/cspt/cocor.htm, seems to be
dead by now.

Import into Github (and the addition of a GPS project file) by
